1. Recursion:
Recursion is a programming approach where a function calls itself to solve smaller subproblems. It's useful for problems with repetitive structure.

2. Recursive Algorithm:
In this program, we recursively multiply the current value by (1 + growthRate) for each year until years = 0.

3. Time Complexity:
- Recursive Method: O(n), where n = number of years
- Iterative Method: O(n), but avoids repeated function calls

4. Optimization:
Recursive calls can lead to stack overflow and redundant calculations. The iterative approach is more efficient and avoids extra memory usage.
