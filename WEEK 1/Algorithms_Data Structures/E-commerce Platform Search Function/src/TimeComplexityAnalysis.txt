Big O Notation:
Big O notation describes how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size. It helps evaluate performance.

Best, Average, and Worst Case for Search:

Linear Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(n)
Worst Case: O(n)

Binary Search:
Best Case: O(1)
Average Case: O(log n)
Worst Case: O(log n)

Comparison:
- Linear search is simple and works on unsorted data.
- Binary search is much faster on sorted data (log n).

Recommendation:
Binary search is more efficient and preferred for e-commerce product search when the data is sorted or indexed.
